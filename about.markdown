<img id="thatsuspng" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/thatsus.png"/> We **love technolog**y, but we also believe that technology is **not neutral**. We promote **mindfulness** when it comes to embracing technology. We do praise technology, but are willing to **ponder upon** both the *benefits* and *harm* it brings to **our lives and the environment**. We believe that there is nothing wrong with progress. However, we give importance to **reusability and repurposing** of technology. 

### This Blog's Ambition

* To curate posts of mindful tech enthusiasts
* To provide a healthy learning environment where tech enthusiasts remain relevant
* To advocate the conscientious use of technology
