<img id="thatsuspng" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/thatsus.png"/> We **love technolog**y, but we also believe that technology is **not neutral**. We promote **mindfulness** when it comes to embracing technology. We do praise technology, but are willing to **ponder upon** both the *benefits* and *harm* it brings to **our lives and the environment**. We believe that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with progress. We are not Luddites. Rather, we are against the wasteful use of tech, frequent discardation of still-usable technology and the over-marketing of unnecessary upgrades of products. We conscientiously advocate the importance to **reusability and repurposing** of technology.
